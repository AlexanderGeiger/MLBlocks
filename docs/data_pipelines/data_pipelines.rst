Data Pipelines
==============

In this section we will go over a few pipeline examples to show **MLBlocks** working
in different scenarios and with different types of data.

For each example, we will be using example datasets which can be downloaded using the
various functions found in the ``mlblocks.datasets`` module.

.. note:: Even though the datasets are not especially big, some of the examples might
          use a considerable amount of resources, especially memory, and might take
          several minutes to run.
